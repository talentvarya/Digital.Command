# Digital Command — Architecture (Phase 1)

## Stack

- **Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript** — server components for data fetching, server actions for all mutations.
- **Supabase**: Postgres + Auth + Storage, accessed via `@supabase/ssr`. RLS is the authorization layer — the app almost never needs the service-role key (see `SECURITY_AND_RLS.md`).
- **TailwindCSS** for styling, `lucide-react` for icons, `zod` for input validation at the server-action boundary.

## Route map

```
/                          Public marketing/landing page
/login /forgot-password /reset-password
/register                  Step 1: account creation (email/password)
/register/check-email      Shown if Supabase requires email confirmation
/register/details          Step 2: business type, package, documents, payment, consent
/pending                   Client-facing status tracker (pre-activation)
/admin/mfa-setup           Forced TOTP enrollment for Super Admin
/admin/dashboard           Stat cards + client table
/admin/clients/[orgId]     Verification/payment review, activation, audit trail
/app/dashboard             Post-activation client dashboard
/api/auth/callback         Exchanges Supabase Auth email-link codes for a session
```

`middleware.ts` (via `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`) refreshes the Supabase session on every request and enforces route guards: auth required for `/admin`, `/app`, `/pending`, `/register/details`; role check + MFA check for `/admin/*`; org-membership + `status === 'active'` check for `/app/*`.

## Data flow for the registration → activation lifecycle

```
/register (signUpAction)
  -> supabase.auth.signUp()
  -> if session returned: /register/details
     else (email confirmation required): /register/check-email -> /login -> getPostLoginRedirect -> /register/details

/register/details (completeRegistrationAction, one server action, one request)
  -> insert organizations (status=draft)
  -> insert organization_members (owner)
  -> insert subscriptions (status=pending)
  -> insert business_verifications (status=draft) + upload docs to Storage + verification_documents rows
  -> update business_verifications.status = submitted
  -> update organizations.status = pending_approval
  -> insert payments (status=pending_verification) [+ screenshot upload]
  -> insert consent_records (one per required policy_versions row)
  -> logAudit('registration_submitted')
  -> redirect /pending

Super Admin (/admin/clients/[orgId] actions)
  -> reviewVerificationAction: business_verifications.status = approved | rejected | more_documents_required
  -> reviewPaymentAction: payments.status = verified | rejected
  -> activateOrgAction (only enabled when verification=approved AND payment=verified): organizations.status = active
       -> DB trigger handle_org_activation(): creates client_settings, activates + dates the subscription
  -> rejectApplicationAction: organizations.status = rejected (terminal)
  -> every action calls logAudit(...)
```

All of the above run under the **calling user's own authenticated session** — RLS policies (not application code) are what actually prevent a client from, say, approving their own verification. See `SECURITY_AND_RLS.md`.

## Modularity seam for future integrations (spec §13/§39)

Nothing in Phase 1 talks to Buffer, Google, Meta, or YouTube yet, but the schema and route structure already assume a **publishing-adapter** shape for Phase 4+:

```
Digital Command (planner, approvals, audit, Brand Brain)
        -> Social Publishing Adapter (interface, not yet implemented)
                -> Buffer   OR   Direct Platform APIs
```

`api_connections` / `api_health_events` tables (spec §25) are intentionally **not created yet** — they'll be added in the phase that actually needs them, so Phase 1's schema stays honest about what's real.

## Directory structure

```
app/                    Route segments (pages + colocated server actions)
components/             Shared UI; admin/, client/, registration/ subfolders for section-specific pieces
lib/
  supabase/             Browser/server/middleware Supabase clients + storage upload helper
  audit/                logAudit() helper used by every mutating action
  auth/                 getPostLoginRedirect(), requireSuperAdmin()
  constants/            Business-type doc requirements, plan pricing, required policy list
  validation/           zod schemas for registration input
  utils/                Request IP/user-agent extraction for audit logs
types/database.ts       Hand-written types mirroring the SQL schema (no live project yet to codegen from)
supabase/migrations/    SQL migrations, run in order (see supabase/README.md)
```
